# CSC492-Senior_Design

NC State University. CSC 492 - Senior Design

This was my capstone project for my last year of undergrad. I had to work with the EcoPRT group at NC State and 3 other students for this project. Information about what EcoPRT is can be found here (https://www.climatecolab.org/contests/2015/transportation/c/proposal/1318201)

We created a web application that had to send/receive data to/from the autonomous car. You could log in to the application with an admin account and were able to create new users through the use of a sign up page. We had to create all the documentation like database schemas, installation guide, API commands, user guide, etc. We used the following technology; Node.js, MongoDB, HTML, Javascript, Bootstrap, and AngularJS. The functionality of web application was given to us by the EcoPRT team. There is a documentation folder in the project folder that has more information about what can be done with the application and how to make it work.
